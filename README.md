# Report Simplification
The reading results for medical images such as CT or MRI are saved in the form of text reports. These reports are used for medical treatment of patients and may be provided directly to the patient.
However, it contains a lot of medical terminology, abbreviations, and difficult expressions, making it difficult for patients to read and understand their meanings.
Therefore, in this study, we focus on developing a methodology that converts complex original reports into simple reports that are easy for patients to understand.
